BitCustom
=========

This repository contains now open-sourced, old Node.js code that ran BitCustom.com - an online vanity Bitcoin address generation service that is now defunct.

This code was kept and posted for educational purposes.  If you find it useful, the only thing I ask is that you tell me what you did with some of it.  That's pretty much it.

Other than that, use the code at your own risk.
